**Definition** -  Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)).

Big O describes the performance of your function (either in time or memory) in the worst case scenario.

Logrithms (*for those that forgot*) - log<sub>X</sub>(Y) means "to what power must I raise X in order to obtain Y".  When no X is listed (e.g. log (Y), the X is implicitly either 2 (computer science), <i>e</i> (mathematics or physics), or 10 (engineering).
