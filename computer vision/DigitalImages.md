# A Path to Understanding Image Manipulation

## Common Image File Types

**BMP**
**GIF**
**PNG**
**JPEG**
**TIFF**


## Terms

**raster graphics** - a dot matrix data structure that represents a generally rectangular grid of pixels.

**lossy (compression)** algorithms preserve a representation of the original uncompressed image that may appear to be a perfect copy, but it is not a perfect copy. Often lossy compression is able to achieve smaller file sizes than lossless compression. Most lossy compression algorithms allow for variable compression that trades image quality for file size. 

**lossless (compression)** algorithms reduce file size while preserving a perfect copy of the original uncompressed image. Lossless compression generally, but not always, results in larger files than lossy compression. Lossless compression should be used to avoid accumulating stages of re-compression when editing images.
